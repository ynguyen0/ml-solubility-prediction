# Molecular Solubility Prediction

## Description
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict molecular solubility using Python's Scikit-Learn library. The model is trained using linear regression techniques, with a focus on evaluating performance through comprehensive model comparison and data visualization. Key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score are used to assess and validate the model's performance.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is validated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
R² Score: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
